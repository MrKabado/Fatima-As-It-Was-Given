            Sister Lucy's Last Public Interview - 1957
          </h1>
          <p id="page2-p" className="text-center mb-5">
            Fr. Augustin Fuentes
          </p>

          <p id="page2-p" className="text-justify">
            A reader recently noted that the interview Sister Lucy gave to Fr.
            Augustin Fuentes in 1957, is always partially reported, and asked TIA
            if we could post the full text. To assist in this request we are now
            posting the most complete text available of the 1957 interview with
            our own translation from the original Spanish. Fr. Augustín Fuentes
            was the Mexican priest named vice-postulator of the cause of
            beatification for Francisco and Jacinta. In that interview Sr. Lucy
            said that Our Lady told her: "The last means that God will give to the
            world for its salvation are the Holy Rosary and My Immaculate Heart."
            <br />
            <br />
            This important conversation of December 26, 1957 was the last public
            interview of Sr. Lucy. After it, permission was refused for any other
            interviews and she was effectively silenced and completely hidden
            away for the next several decades.
            <br />
            <br />
            Another very jovial Sr. Lucy appeared 10 years later in 1967 during
            Paul VI's visit to Fatima. This Sr. Lucy, square-faced, cheerful and
            robust - incredibly different from the oval faced, sad and pale Sr.
            Lucy who spoke to Fr. Fuentes - was seen more regularly starting in
            1982, after John Paul II's visit to Fatima.
            <br />
            <br />
            These are the authentic words of her 1957 conversation with Fr.
            Fuentes, which came from the records of the official archivist of
            Fatima, Fr. Joaquín María Alonso, CMF. Fr. Alonso spoke with Sr. Lucy
            and publicly testified that her statements to Fr. Fuentes in 1957
            were genuine and true.
            <br />
            <br />
            This text is from his book, La verdad sobre el Secreto de Fátima,
            Fátima sin mitos [The Truth about the Secret of Fatima without Myths].
            The text has the approval and imprimatur of Archbishop Sánchez of
            Santa Cruz, Mexico.
            <br />
            <br />
            What follows is the literal translation of Fr. Fuentes' text
            reporting what he heard "from the lips of" the seer of Fatima. TIA

              Speaking to the sisters of Motherhouse of the Missionaries of the
              Sacred Heart in Mexico on May 22, 1958, Fr. Fuentes said, "I want to
              tell you the last conversation I had with her [Sister Lucy], which
              was on December 26 of last year. It was in the convent, where I
              found her very sad, pale and drawn."
              <br />
              <br />
              He then proceeded to read Sister Lucy's words to him at the
              December 26, 1957, interview:
              <br />
              <br />
              "Father, the Blessed Virgin is very sad because no one has paid
              attention to her Message, neither the good nor the bad. The good,
              because they continue on the road of goodness, but without paying
              mind to this Message. The bad, because of their sins, do not see
              God's chastisement already falling on them presently; they also
              continue on their path of badness, ignoring the Message. But,
              Father, you must believe me that God is going to punish the world
              and chastise it in a tremendous way.
              <br />
              <br />
              "The chastisement from Heaven is imminent. The year 1960 is on us,
              and then what will happen? It will be very sad for everyone, and
              far from a happy thing if the world does not pray and do penance
              before then. I cannot give more details, because it is still a
              secret. By the will of the Blessed Virgin, only the Holy Father and
              the Bishop of Fatima can know the secret. Both have chosen,
              however, not to open it in order not to be influenced by it.
              <br />
              <br />
              "This is the third part of the Message of Our Lady, which still
              remains secret until 1960. Tell them, Father, that the Blessed
              Virgin said repeatedly - to my cousins Francisco and Jacinta as
              well as to me - that many nations would disappear from the face of
              the earth, that Russia would be the instrument of chastisement
              from Heaven for the whole world if the conversion of that poor
              Nation is not obtained beforehand. ..."

              Sr. Lucy also told me:
              <br />
              <br />
              "Father, the Devil is fighting a decisive battle against the
              Virgin and, as you know, what most offends God and what will gain
              him the greatest number of souls in the shortest time is to gain
              the souls consecrated to God. For this also leaves unprotected the
              field of the laity and the Devil can more easily seize them.
              <br />
              <br />
              "Also, Father, tell them that my cousins Francisco and Jacinta
              made sacrifices because they always saw the Blessed Virgin was
              very sad in all her apparitions. She never smiled at us. This
              anguish that we saw in her, caused by offenses to God and the
              chastisements that threaten sinners, penetrated our souls. And
              being children, we did not know what measures to devise except to
              pray and make sacrifices. ..."

            <p id="page2-p" className="text-justify">
              "For this reason, Father, it is my mission not just to tell about
              the material punishments that will certainly come over the earth
              if the world does not pray and do penance. No, my mission is to
              tell everyone the imminent danger we are in of losing our souls
              for all eternity if we remain fixed in sin.
              <br />
              <br />
              "Father, we should not wait for a call to the world from Rome on
              the part of the Holy Father to do penance. Nor should we wait for
              a call for penance to come from the Bishops in our Dioceses, nor
              from our Religious Congregations. No, Our Lord has often used
              these means, and the world has not paid heed. So, now each one of
              us must begin to reform himself spiritually. Each one has to save
              not only his own soul, but also all the souls that God has placed
              on his pathway.

              "Father, the Blessed Virgin did not tell me that we are in the
              last times of the world, but I understood this for three reasons:
              <br />
              <br />
              "The first is because she told me that the Devil is engaging in a
              battle with the Virgin, a decisive battle. It is a final battle
              where one party will be victorious and the other will suffer
              defeat. So, from now on, we are either with God or we are with the
              Devil; there is no middle ground.
              <br />
              <br />
              "The second reason is because she told me, as well as my cousins,
              that God is giving two last remedies to the world: the Holy
              Rosary and devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.
              <br />
              <br />
              "And the third, because in the plans of the Divine Providence, when God is going to chastise the world He always first exhausts all other remedies. When He sees that the world pays no attention whatsoever, then, as we say in our imperfect way of talking, with a certain fear He presents us the last means of salvation, His Blessed Mother."
              <br />
              <br />
              If we despise and reject this last means, Heaven will no longer pardon us, because we will have committed a sin that the Gospel calls a sin against the Holy Spirit. This sin consists in openly rejecting - with full knowledge and will - the salvation that is put in our hands.
              <br />
              <br />
              "Also, since Our Lord is a very good Son, He will not permit that we offend and despise His Blessed Mother. We have as obvious testimony the history of different centuries where Our Lord has shown us with terrible examples how He has always defended the honor of His Blessed Mother.
              <br />
              <br />
              "Prayer and sacrifice are the two means to save the world. As for the Holy Rosary, Father, in these last times in which we are living, the Blessed Virgin has given a new efficacy to the praying of the Holy Rosary. This in such a way that there is no problem that cannot be resolved by praying the Rosary, no matter how difficult it is - be it temporal or above all spiritual - in the spiritual life of each of us or the lives of our families, be they our families in the world or Religious Communities, or even in the lives of peoples and nations.
              <br />
              <br />
              "I repeat, there is no problem, as difficult as it may be, that we cannot resolve at this time by praying the Holy Rosary. With the Holy Rosary we will save ourselves, sanctify ourselves, console Our Lord and obtain the salvation of many souls.
