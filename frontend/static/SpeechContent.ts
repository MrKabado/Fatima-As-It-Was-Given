Not A Promise Of Peace, But A Remedy For Souls.

ABOUT THIS SITE
Fatima, 
Heaven did not come to negotiate peace, 
but to warn of impending loss. 
The vision of Hell, showing souls falling into Hell, seemingly in real time,
is a clear sign of the urgency of the message. God wishes to save souls from Hell by Repentance,
Reparation, and Obedience. This site exists to restore that order.

About the danger
Fatima begins where it must: with the vision of eternity in Hell. The children were shown Hell to show them what is at stake in as striking a manner as possible. Little Jacinta spent the rest of her life doing little sacrifices to save sinners from that fate. Everything at Fatima is ordered—that souls might be saved.

I believe that at Fatima the greatest danger revealed was not the persecution from without, but the deception from within. The gravest possibility raised by the message is that souls may be lost, not through rebellion against God, but through misplaced trust, when authority is followed with blind trust, and obedience is detached from truth.

Lucia understood that the most terrible suffering is not physical destruction, but eternal loss; not martyrdom, but being led away from the path of salvation while believing oneself to be secure.

This is the message of Fatima first addressed to those entrusted with guidance, and only then to those dependent on that guidance.

Where clarity is absent, and silence replaces truth, where error is allowed to masquerade as reassurance, the danger is not just confusion..

IT IS THE LOSS OF SOULS.
IT IS "TOO AWFUL FOR MANKIND"


ABOUT THE REMEDY
At Fatima Jesus did not present His Mother's Immaculate Heart as a devotion, but as a devotion equal to our devotion to His Own Sacred Heart. Lucia repeatedly affirmed that Jesus wished to establish devotion to Her Immaculate Heart, as a means by which souls would be saved.

Not to diminish Him in any way, but to obey Him, because salvation only comes from Jesus, but by His Will through Her Immaculate Heart.

Lucia's story leads us to that final interview in 1957 with Father Fuentes, in which she describes Our Lady's final words for us. The final battle She is having with Satan, where we must actively choose Her side to be saved, or be lost to his by default.

Our Lady bemoans the lack of help available to us. She stresses that our only help is daily Rosary and devotion to Her Immaculate Heart.

These are not guarantees of peace, but co-operation with grace, and

GRACE IS WHAT SAVES SOULS.


ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITY
My soul is not saved because I know that confusion exists.

My soul is not saved because clarity is hard to find.

Salvation is personal.

My job is not to solve the crises.

My job is to be faithful because of them.


...


I am responsible for that.
•
I am responsible for my daily rosary.
•
I am responsible to consecrate myself to the Immaculate Heart.
•
I am responsible to make reparation for insults to Her.


OBSERVATIONS TO PONDER
Lucia's credibility was firmly established in July 1917 when she told people who had asked for the Lady to prove She was from Heaven.

Lucia clearly stated that the Lady would do so at noon, at the Cova, on 13th of October. This is the ONLY exact future prediction in history. The Press saw this, when others did not, and they gave us every word from Lucia afterwards, directly.

The requests mentioned in the Fatima story were seemingly meant for the authorities, they were not. They were for us to discern what happened to them.

Jesus does not, and will not, punish me. Bad things can happen to me because I am not "with Him". His love is always with me, but sometimes my love is not with Him, that is when I am at risk. He does not falter, I do.

Lucia said that Our Lady was always sad, and never smiled. This brought home to her the seriousness of the message.

Fatima does not promise safety in history. Fatima does promise that no soul need be lost for lack of grace. Everything Heaven asked for was given so that, even in a time of confusion, a soul willing to obey could still find its way.

Our Lady at Fatima leaves no middle ground, either the remedy is taken seriously, or the consequences will follow.
